# Welcome to my online space

Hi, I am Kushal (full name is Potturu Sai Venkat Kushal), I am 5th year Dual Degree student pursuing Electrical Engineering in Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I love reading books especially when they have good content to provide to help and guide me develop myself. I love reading blogs from authors like James Clear, Mark Manson. I am interested in diverse subjects like maths (sometimes I get afraid of the big problems working on it though), computer science(especially related to alogrithms it is amazing how they influnece our day to day life), philosphy, neuroscience, and hardware
