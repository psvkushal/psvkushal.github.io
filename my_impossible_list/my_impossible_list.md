# Impossible list 

Started writing on 08/07/21 at 4:33 pm (The time does not matters I guess nothing is exact in this world)

I got inspiration from reading Thomas Frank [impossible list](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/) in CIG website so I wanted to write down what is my impossible list and work on it


# Academic Goals
* ~~Graduate from my university (IITM) with above 9.3 GPA~~
  * Failed this goal graduated with 8.75  
* ~~Publish a paper in any reputed jornal~~
  * Failed this goal too did not manage to complete a good project given the deadline
